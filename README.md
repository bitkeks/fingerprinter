# Fingerprinter

With Fingerprinter you can run a webinterface which let's others check
fingerprints against a configured list of your own key fingerprints.

Simply compile, customize the config, add all your fingerprints to the
fingerprints.dat CSV file and start the service. It automatically parses the CSV
and creates the data entries.

## Screenshots

Pretty simple interface.
